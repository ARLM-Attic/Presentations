If we could redesign FTP and HTTP today, how would they look different?

This language-agnostic talk will teach you everything you need to know about designing application protocols for TCP/IP. The three essential pillars of TCP/IP protocols will be covered in depth: Connections, Message Framing, and Keepalives. We'll use HTTP and FTP as examples, observing how (and why) they have changed over the years.

You'll also learn enough to implement a TCP/IP protocol of your own, should the need arise. Some day we'll all be using REST and WebSockets, but it is still very common to have to deal with hand-grown protocols; after attending this session, you'll be able to identify and clearly explain subtle problems with any TCP/IP protocol.
