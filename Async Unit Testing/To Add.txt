Frameworks:
- MSTest
- NUnit
- xUnit
- Fixie

Mocking:
- MSFakes
- Moq
- FakeItEasy
- Typemock Isolator
- nSubstitute

Assertions:
- Shouldly
- Fluent Assertions
- MSTest
- NUnit
- xUnit

- Evaluate: FakeItEasy (automocks task-returning async methods), Fixie, Shouldly, Fluent Assertions, Typemock Isolator, nSubstitute (automocks task-returning async methods).
  - Typemock: http://www.typemock.com/answers/11483/testing-async-tasks-with-isolator
  - Fixie: http://patrick.lioi.net/2013/04/24/cutting-scope/
  - Shouldly: ShouldThrow and ShouldThrowAsync extensions on Task and Should.CompleteIn(task).
- Unit testing timeout scenarios (Rx TestScheduler)? The Second Advanced Topic.

Grades for unit test frameworks:
+ Should support async Task test methods.
+ Should either support async void test methods OR provide a warning for async void test methods.
+ Should either always provide a queue-based SyncCtx or never provide a queue-based SyncCtx.

Grades for mocking frameworks:
+ Automocking should not return null tasks.
+ Should provide easy setups for asynchronous methods (FromResult, FromException).

Grades for assertion frameworks:
+ Should support async happy path (success).
+ Should support async failure scenarios.
+ Should never do sync-over-async.
