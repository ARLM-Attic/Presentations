Async/await is one of the most celebrated language improvements in modern times, but does it have a place in server-side code? The answer is most definitely "yes," and this talk will explore using async and await on the server.

We'll start out with an introduction to async and await, with a special emphasis on the benefits that asynchronous code brings to the server side. In particular, we'll examine how async can help you scale (and situations where it won't!).

Next, we'll cover the basic requirements for using async/await on ASP.NET. We'll discuss common problems and solutions, and solve some "pain points" for async servers.

You'll walk away with a solid understanding of asynchronous ASP.NET solutions, how they compare with Node.js, and how to avoid the common pitfalls.
