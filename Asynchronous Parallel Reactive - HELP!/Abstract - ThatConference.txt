- Nature hike through the .NET concurrency landscape

Asynchronous? Parallel? Reactive? Help!

The modern landscape of concurrency can certainly be confusing, and it's natural to feel lost! Join us for a guided hike on a gentle trail through the many forms of concurrency. The first stop on our trail is the most common and familiar: parallelism. We'll briefly study the important aspects of the two landmarks there: the Parallel class and Parallel LINQ.

The next stop will be asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is a totally different kind of concurrency than parallel processing, and we'll learn the basics of how the async and await undergrowth helps us build maintainable asynchronous code.

Along the way, we'll observe the local wildlife in the form of TPL Dataflow. A beautiful mix of parallel and asynchronous techniques, TPL Dataflow is a little-known but extremely powerful library.

The final stop is Reactive Extensions (Rx), yet another form of concurrency. We'll examine the concepts behind Rx as well as the most useful operators. And I'll keep it practical; I promise not to say "mathematical dual of IEnumerable" even once.
